# Celestial-Bodies-Database

- The first project required for freeCodeCamp's Relational Database certification

## Description

- A database that has information about our universe divided into; galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and comets.

## Technologies Used

Bash, SQL, postgreSQL

NOTE: I am very aware how inaccurate the inputs for mass, diameter, etc are for these. I plan on fixing that in the future. I just wanted to internalize the postgreSQL syntax.
